some new concept
1 Const Data Members = Once,initialization, they can't changed their valye
 eg:- const int a=2;
2) initialization list= initialization constant and well as other data Members
  float function_name(int x,float y):price(x){

  }
3) Const Parameters = which don't get updated inside that function
eg= float function_name(int c, cons int a){
    a will not get updated inside this function;
}
4) Const functions = which don't update data members of the class
 eg:- float function_name(int s, int g) const{
    this funciton will not be able to change or update any data members;
 }
