catalan's number

ques) how many binary trees can you make with n number of nodes?
ans):-
    total number of nodes are 1,2,3,4,,,,,,,n
    now we can choose any node as root node
    so total number of ways of choosing root is n
    lets say i choose ith number as my root node
    now on left side of the root i will have i-1 nodes available to make a bst
    and on right i will have n-i nodes available


    now in order to make a complete binary tree i will have to choose one bst from left and one bst from right and combine it with the root node
    lets say x=i-1 and y=n-1 
    so choose one bst out of all bst from left is xC1
    similarly for choosing one bst form right is yC1
    so it becomes xC1*1*yC1 as the total bst that can be fromed if i choose ith as my root node
    similary if i choose each element one time as root node for my bst then total number of bst that can become from n nodes are:-
    f(n)=summation of from i=1 to i=n f(x).f(y);

    a sumple formula for this is(also called catalan number):- 2nCn/n+1;
    total number of unlabelled binary trees(talking about the structure of tree)=same as total number of bst that is  2nCn/n+1
    total number of binary trees are:- n!*(2nCn/n+1);
