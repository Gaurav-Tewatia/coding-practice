Containers IN STL
1 :- Sequence Containers: implement data structure which can be accessed in a Sequenceial manner
   - vector
   - list
   - deque
   - arrays
   - forward list (single linked list)

2 :- Container Adapters: provide a different interface for sequential Containers
   - queue
   - priority queue
   - stack

3 :- Associative Container: implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (OlogN) complexity
   - set 
   - multiset
   - map
   - multimap

4 :- Unordered Associative Containers: implement Unordered data structures that can be quickly searched
   - Unordered_set
   - Unordered_multiset
   - Unordered_map
   - Unordered_multimap
