Iterator
Iterators as an entity that helps us to access the data within a container with certain restriction

1:- Input interators:
   a entity through which you can read data from contaier and move ahead
   for example: A keyboard

2:- Output interators
   a entity through which  you can write into the container and move ahead
   eg:- printer

3:- Forward interator
   iterator with functionalities of input and ouput iterator in single direction
   for ex:- singly linked list

4:- Bidirection iterator
   forward iterator that can move in both direction

5:- Random Access iterator
   Random Access iterator is an iterator that can read/write in both direction and also can take jump

   Why learn iterator?

   we want to make generic algorithm wiht freedom from underlying data structure

   example:-
   we made search() function to work on all data-types using Templates
   NOw we can make search() function to work on all types of containers using iterators
